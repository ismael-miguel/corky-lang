This is a file showing how to make an improved "hello world" program.

Check the previous example to see how to make a basic "hello world" program.

Creates a string and stores the string "hello, world!" into it:

:define:~0:text :store:cons@"hello, world!"

:import@text > still needed, no escape sequences

:echo
	
	:~0 
	
	:text@newline

And this is how you make an improved hello world in corky!
