This is a file showing how to make a "hello world" program.

First we need to import the module "text" for string manipulation

:load@text < needed for the newline char

:echo < similar to many languages

	:cons@"hello, world!" < we create a constant of type "text" to hand it over for output
	
	:text@newline < this is a cool constant

And this is how you make a hello world in corky!
